Ken Jia-Quan Yu currently works as a software engineer at MediaTek Inc., where his primary responsibility is maintaining and developing image warping drivers. Before joining MediaTek, Ken earned his master's degree from National Taiwan University in Communication Engineering Department, where he focusses on monocular 3D object detection and image segmentation. Prior to his Master's, he ventured into the robotics field, working as a research assistant and software engineer at a startup company. Ken completed his undergraduate studies at National Taiwan University, majoring in Mechanical Engineering.

Ken's main research interests lie in computer vision and robotics. He is particularly fascinated by how AI can enhance the understanding of 3D scene structures and revolutionize robot perception algorithms. He is also intrigued by image processing and image generation.

Beyond his academic pursuits, Ken has two years of software development experience. He initially worked as a software engineer at a robotics startup, developing an elevator control system that enables robots to use elevators. Subsequently, he led a multi-robot transportation system project as a research assistant in National Taiwan University. Most recently, he has been concentrating on basic camera algorithm development at MediaTek. These experiences have significantly honed his software development skills and fueled his passion for coding.

In his leisure time, Ken enjoys playing badminton and drums.
