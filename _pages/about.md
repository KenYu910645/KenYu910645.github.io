I worked in Robotics Industry and Laboratory and have some hand-on experience on building the navigation and localization system for in-door robots. During these working experience, I found that Computer Vision is the core technology for robots to keep evolving in the future. Thus, I decided to study in the graduate school of NTU GICE last year and began my learning journey for the newest technologies of Deep Learning and Computer Vision.
