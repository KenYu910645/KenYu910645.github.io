Ken (Jia-Quan) Yu is a software engineer at MediaTek Inc., where he develops and maintains mobile phone camera drivers and integrates AI tools to improve software team efficiency in porting and debugging. He holds a master’s degree in Communication Engineering from National Taiwan University, where he specialized in monocular 3D object detection and image segmentation, and a bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the same institution.

With three years of software development experience, Ken has worked across semiconductor, robotics, and computer vision domains. He previously contributed to a robotics startup and led a multi-robot transportation system project at National Taiwan University before joining MediaTek. These roles strengthened his expertise in computer vision, embedded systems, and automation.

Ken’s core interests center on computer vision, robotics, and AI applications in real-world systems. He is particularly driven by building solutions that enhance efficiency, automate workflows, and bridge the gap between AI research and production-grade software.

Outside of work, Ken enjoys playing badminton, pickleball, and drums.
