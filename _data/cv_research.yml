      description:
        - title: Monocular 3D Object Detection
          contents:
            - Developed a convolutional module that guides the neural network to exploit visual clues like road landmarks to assess objects distance to the camera. This innovation yielded a +1.4% improvement in average precision (AP)
        - title: Segmentation plus Depth
          contents:
            - Combined panoptic segmentation and depth estimation into a unified, end-to-end network architecture. Visualized segments depth with color map to enhance autonomous driving safety
        - title: Scene-aware Data Augmentation
          contents:
            - Integrated segmented objects into different scenes to reuse their training labels. Used depth maps as references to ensure realistic object label generation, resulting in +2.35% in AP
        - title: Safety Metric for Object Detection
          contents:
            - Calculated weights to on-road objects based on their relevance to driving safety. Utilized the weighted average precision to better evaluate performance of object detection algorithms
